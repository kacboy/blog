            "content_html": "<p>In a surprise turn of events, Uncharted 2 multiplayer has been revived! Thanks to a dedicated user named Force, players can once again dive into the nostalgic battles of this classic game. If you've been longing to revisit Uncharted 2's online multiplayer, now's your chance.</p>\n<h2>The History of Uncharted 2's Multiplayer Shutdown</h2>\n<p>Back in 2019, Sony officially shut down the multiplayer servers for Uncharted 2, Uncharted 3, and The Last of Us on PS3. While The Last of Us Remastered on PS4 still maintains its factions multiplayer mode, and Uncharted 3 multiplayer was brought back through LAN networking solutions, Uncharted 2 was left in the dark. Due to its requirement for a network handshake and lack of built-in LAN functionality, reviving the game seemed nearly impossible—until now.</p>\n<h2>The Revival of Uncharted 2 Multiplayer</h2>\n<p>A user named Force has successfully restored Uncharted 2's multiplayer servers, making it possible for players to enjoy custom matches once again. He revealed that the necessary network data and files had already been captured five years ago, yet no one had managed to bring it back online—until now.</p>\n<p>I was fortunate enough to test his server solution firsthand, and let me tell you, the experience was surreal. If you still own a PS3 and a copy of Uncharted 2 (digital or physical), you can now hop back into multiplayer and co-op modes. Even better, Force is working on an RPCS3 emulator version, which will allow PC players to join in the future.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qyHfMbsKG74\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>How to Get Started</h2>\n<p>If you're eager to jump back into Uncharted 2 multiplayer, here’s how you can set up access to the revived servers:</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Join the Discord Community</h3>\n<p>To get access to the server, you’ll need to join Force’s Discord server (linked below). There, you can get your PlayStation Network (PSN) name approved and receive the necessary DNS IP address to connect to the multiplayer servers.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Configure Your PS3 Network Settings</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>On your PS3, navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Network Settings</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Settings and Connection Status List</strong> and take note of your current IP address, subnet mask, and default router address.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to <strong>Internet Connection Settings</strong>, select <strong>Custom</strong>, and choose either <strong>Wired</strong> or <strong>Wireless</strong> based on your setup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you reach the <strong>IP Address Setting</strong> section, choose <strong>Manual</strong> and enter the details you noted earlier.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For <strong>Primary DNS</strong>, enter the DNS IP address provided in the Discord server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) If you experience connection issues, set the <strong>Secondary DNS</strong> to <strong>8.8.8.8</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the settings and test your internet connection.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your internet and PSN connections are successful, you should be ready to launch Uncharted 2 multiplayer!</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting Tips</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Game Freezing at the Loading Screen?</strong> Go to <strong>Game Data Utility</strong>, delete Uncharted 2’s game data, and reinstall all updates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Syncing Live Data Takes Too Long?</strong> The first connection might take a while, but subsequent attempts should be much faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DLC Availability Issues?</strong> It varies by PSN region, so try accessing the PlayStation Store directly instead of the in-game store.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What to Expect in Multiplayer</h2>\n<p>Once you're in, you’ll find that your rank, leaderboards, and trophy progress are still there from 2019. At the moment, only custom games are available, so you’ll need to invite other players to join matches. However, matchmaking is on the roadmap for future updates!</p>\n<p>Additionally, cinema mode works, meaning players can once again create montages and machinima content. This is a fantastic opportunity to relive the golden days of Uncharted 2 multiplayer with a fresh community.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d be playing Uncharted 2 multiplayer again, but here we are! A massive shoutout to Force and the community working behind the scenes to make this happen. If you’re a fan of the series, dust off your PS3 and dive back into one of the best multiplayer experiences ever created.</p>\n<h3>Join the Action</h3>\n<p>To start playing, join the <strong>Discord community</strong> (link below) and follow the steps to set up your connection. Hope to see you in the game!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q1fVvjaXH90\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<hr>\n<p>Uncharted 2 Revived <a href=\"https://discord.gg/9pJrhnhucz\">https://discord.gg/9pJrhnhucz</a><br>Reddit Announcement <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unchartedmultiplayer/comments/1jfbpm5/uncharted_2_revived_no_gatekeeping_just_pure/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/unchartedmultiplayer/comments/1jfbpm5/uncharted_2_revived_no_gatekeeping_just_pure/</a><br>Uncharted 3 Reloaded <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/jtvQ7sQcZS\">https://discord.com/invite/jtvQ7sQcZS</a><br>Retro Fighters Defender Controller <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3yNFA7w\">https://amzn.to/3yNFA7w</a></p>",

It might seem impossible, but converting 4K Blu-ray to PSP format is totally doable with the right tools. This guide will show you how to rip, compress, and transfer high-quality video to your PSP for watching movies anywhere.</p>\n<div class=\"se-component se-video-container __se__float-none\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<figure>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2nHJiC4dZgw?t=47s\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></figure>\n</figure>\n<h2>What You'll Need to Convert 4K Blu-rays to PSP</h2>\n<p>Before we start converting, here's what you'll need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray disc</li>\n<li>A Blu-ray drive that can read 4K discs</li>\n<li>MakeMKV for ripping the disc</li>\n<li>Handbrake for compressing the video</li>\n<li>A USB cable to connect your PSP</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Rip 4K Blu-rays with MakeMKV</h2>\n<p>First, we'll use MakeMKV to get the video off the disc:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install and open MakeMKV on your computer.</li>\n<li>Put the 4K Blu-ray in your drive.</li>\n<li>MakeMKV will scan the disc. Pick the biggest file - that's usually the main movie.</li>\n<li>Choose where to save the file and start ripping.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This part can take a while, depending on your computer and how big the movie is.</p>\n<h2>Compressing Video for PSP with Handbrake</h2>\n<p>Now that you have the MKV file, let's compress it for the PSP using Handbrake:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and install Handbrake.</li>\n<li>Get the PSP preset (check the video description for a link).</li>\n<li>Open your MKV file in Handbrake.</li>\n<li>Use the PSP preset - it sets most things automatically.</li>\n<li>For 4K HDR videos, go to Filters and change the color space to BT.709 so it works on PSP.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Tweaking Video Settings for PSP</h3>\n<p>The preset covers most things, but you might want to change a few settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PSP video size: Standard PSP screens are 480x272. You can go up to 720x576 for better quality.</li>\n<li>Aspect ratio: For widescreen movies, try 720x576 and leave other settings on auto.</li>\n<li>Cropping: You can cut out black bars to save space, or keep them to zoom in later on your PSP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you're happy with the settings, start compressing. It'll take about 30 minutes, give or take, depending on your computer and the length of the movie.</p>\n<h2>Getting Your Movie onto the PSP</h2>\n<p>Once your video is compressed, here's how to put it on your PSP:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Plug your PSP into your computer with a USB cable.</li>\n<li>Set your PSP to USB mode so your computer sees it as a drive.</li>\n<li>Drag your compressed video file to the VIDEO folder on your PSP.</li>\n<li>Safely unplug your PSP.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To watch your movie:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the Video section on your PSP's main menu.</li>\n<li>Find your video file and select it to play.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Making Videos Look Great on PSP</h2>\n<p>For the best picture on your PSP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try different resolutions to find what looks best without taking up too much space.</li>\n<li>Use the PSP's zoom feature to adjust widescreen videos if needed.</li>\n<li>Higher resolution files (like 720x576) can look better even on the small PSP screen, especially for videos without black bars.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>PSP Storage Tips</h2>\n<p>Keep in mind that better quality videos take up more space. You might want to get a bigger memory stick if you plan to keep lots of movies on your PSP.</p>\n<p>Converting 4K Blu-rays to PSP format lets you take your HD movies anywhere. It might seem tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, you can fine-tune the process to get exactly what you want.</p>\n<h2>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>\n<h4>Can I use this method for regular Blu-rays or DVDs?</h4>\n<p>Yes, this method works for any video source, including standard Blu-rays and DVDs. The process remains the same, but you may not need to adjust the color space settings for non-HDR content.</p>\n<h4>Will converting 4K content to PSP resolution result in a significant quality loss?</h4>\n<p>While there will be some quality loss due to the lower resolution, proper compression settings can still result in a very watchable video on the PSP's screen. The higher quality source material often leads to better results even at lower resolutions.</p>\n<h4>How much storage space do converted movies typically take up on a PSP?</h4>\n<p>This varies depending on the length of the movie and your compression settings. Generally, a 2-hour movie converted to PSP format might range from 700MB to 1.5GB.</p>\n<h4>Is it legal to rip and convert Blu-rays I own?</h4>\n<p>The legality of <a href=\"https://www.avsforum.com/threads/ripping-uhd-4k-discs-with-makemkv-instructions-how-to.2942740/page-226\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ripping Blu-rays</a> varies by country. In many places, it's legal to make a backup copy for personal use, but it's always best to check your local laws.</p>\n<h4>Can I use other video conversion software instead of Handbrake?</h4>\n<p>Yes, there are other video conversion tools available. However, Handbrake is free, regularly updated, and has a good reputation for quality and flexibility, making it an excellent choice for this task.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string yt-core-attributed-string--white-space-pre-wrap\" dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\">Updated Preset </span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"><a href=\"https://kacboy.com/files/Handbrake.PSP.720x576.json\">https://kacboy.com/files/Handbrake.PSP.720x576.json</a></span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"> <br>Original Preset </span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/psp_20240812\">https://archive.org/details/psp_20240812</a></span></span></p>\n</div>",

This guide will walk you through the latest working methods in 2025.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypUaFIgioQw\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>Method 1: Using the Hidden PS Portal Browser</h2>\n<p>Unlike the PS5, the PS Portal actually has a built-in browser that can be accessed through system settings.</p>\n<h3>Steps:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Go to Settings</strong> on your PS Portal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to <strong>Legal Notices</strong> → <strong>Other Documents</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on any link within this section to open the PlayStation website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From there, you can browse <strong>within PlayStation.com</strong>, but external links will be blocked.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Limitations</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You can only access PlayStation-related content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some embedded YouTube videos on PlayStation’s site may work, but external links are restricted.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Method 2: Using PSN Messaging to Open URLs</h2>\n<p>Since the built-in browser is extremely limited, the best alternative is to open a web browser via PSN messages—similar to how it works on PS5.</p>\n<h3>Steps:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Find an old or inactive PSN account</strong> to send messages to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Send a message</strong> containing a working URL.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Google, YouTube, Bing, and DuckDuckGo are blocked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Brave.com</strong> is currently the best working search engine alternative.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Open the message on your PS Portal</strong> and click the link.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This will launch the browser, giving you some access to external websites.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>💡 <em>Bonus Tip</em>: You can also use a custom website like <strong><a href=\"https://kacboy.com/ps5\">kacboy.com/PS5</a></strong>, which has quick links to popular web destinations.</p>\n<h2>Method 3: Watch Dogs 2 Web Browser Trick</h2>\n<p>A lesser-known workaround involves using <em>Watch Dogs 2</em> (available on PlayStation Plus), which includes a browser in its main menu.</p>\n<h3>Steps:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Download and launch Watch Dogs 2</strong> from PlayStation Plus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From the <strong>main menu</strong>, look at the lower-right corner where social media news items appear.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the <strong>second news item</strong>, which leads to a <strong>Twitter/X support page</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scroll to the bottom of that page and click the <strong>Google Chrome link</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This will open a <strong>full-screen browser</strong> where you can access Google Search.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Limitations</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You <strong>can’t go back</strong> using the Circle button—pressing it closes the browser completely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There’s <strong>no accessibility zoom</strong> on the PS Portal, making navigation difficult.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No full-screen mode</strong>, which limits usability.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 data-pm-slice=\"1 3 []\">Other PS5 Games with Built-in Browsers</h3>\n<p>According to user comments, the following PS5 games also have built-in browsers that can be accessed similarly:</p>\n<ul data-spread=\"false\">\n<li>\n<p><em>Watch Dogs 2</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Dying Light 1</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Uno</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Battlefield 2042</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Minecraft</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>While Sony continues to restrict browser functionality on PlayStation devices, these methods are still viable for now. The PS Portal’s built-in browser is mostly locked down, so your best bet is using the PSN messaging method or the <em>Watch Dogs 2</em> trick.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if these methods still work or if you find a better workaround! 🎮🌐</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string yt-core-attributed-string--white-space-pre-wrap\" dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"><a href=\"https://kacboy.com/ps5\">kacboy.com/ps5</a> <br></span></span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string yt-core-attributed-string--white-space-pre-wrap\" dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\">PS Portal </span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"><a class=\"yt-core-attributed-string__link yt-core-attributed-string__link--call-to-action-color\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqblc2YV9yNUFpY2Z1T2VNYk5tOGpaQ0ozak04UXxBQ3Jtc0tuRFN2eGR2VDVWWU4zdVNXNGRjS2ViaE5QZ3AzbWpJRERNbFBDcG44YjNZbXBkSk92TE1WTTFGRUtuZHM5dmFOVzZQSzVoYjhVSFg1Nl8zNzh5NGZDMmVSY2dKaEJwdlN3UzlxcU9CbWY2RzkwTmhVYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3VwoRi3&amp;v=ypUaFIgioQw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" force-new-state=\"true\" tabindex=\"0\">https://amzn.to/3VwoRi3</a></span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"> <br></span></span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string yt-core-attributed-string--white-space-pre-wrap\" dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\">PS5 </span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"><a class=\"yt-core-attributed-string__link yt-core-attributed-string__link--call-to-action-color\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbW8xNDdNREVjNGlzZ09CMkhCTTdIeXNfSUhzd3xBQ3Jtc0ttejU2N2FwZkJLb0NidkkxWDJmWkN3dWI3bE53TUozWkR5QTNENzB1WFc0U0lTcXB4QTZHTlJNemRwZU52VHZwREZWZkhnUy1kNnN3LWpQcVNnNDNZMWY1Q2VDZk5JNThNY0RlNXgxa1Z5QmlBUkZkWQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3KB9MWg&amp;v=ypUaFIgioQw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" force-new-state=\"true\" tabindex=\"0\">https://amzn.to/3KB9MWg</a></span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"> <br>DualSense </span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"><a class=\"yt-core-attributed-string__link yt-core-attributed-string__link--call-to-action-color\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbnppelhfbklZVkZCYzRVd0hlLUNuNGw5dnJid3xBQ3Jtc0tsdE5WcHkzeS1BdHUxUmcxNUw1N3MtY2VXejVtTXp4ZmRFQXU1UDJYZFFzZnVNdDMwcXFzdXo5cFBKVGxPa3ZFQ2JxQmtLaW1pMDRLMWNQZUVFTkd4Qk9rQUh2VGlENEt0a3ozTUVobUNMVDU0eW5Tcw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3RhL1lo&amp;v=ypUaFIgioQw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" force-new-state=\"true\" tabindex=\"0\">https://amzn.to/3RhL1lo</a></span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"> <br>Watch Dogs 2 </span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"><a class=\"yt-core-attributed-string__link yt-core-attributed-string__link--call-to-action-color\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWpvT3lvTXZ3QWFYdHRNbHBVRmVNaG9ucENUZ3xBQ3Jtc0trV01LeUpFUzBDUl9fTU81NHpMY2szU1NsOWVWTGlQWm9ab0F6X2hSMjBZcGNNQVlFZG4yRnR0ek1CR3p2dHo1TloxT3gzUTZhSVdwd1JRa2dqU3JtTi1GalFrdkZuMkllMDNmOUgtMWVOdmNLTHp4Yw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F4aKdklb&amp;v=ypUaFIgioQw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" force-new-state=\"true\" tabindex=\"0\">https://amzn.to/4aKdklb</a></span></span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4jcZYSm \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8BitDo Micro Bluetooth Controller</a> is a compact and versatile gaming accessory that's making waves in the portable gaming world. Priced at around $25 USD or $35 CAD, this pint-sized powerhouse offers a range of features that make it an attractive option for gamers on the go. Let's take a closer look at what this tiny controller has to offer.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_52Y_uLTUQQ?t=14s\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>Unboxing and Design: A Pocket-Sized Gaming Marvel</h2>\n<p>Upon unboxing the 8BitDo Micro Bluetooth Controller, you'll find the controller itself, a color-coordinated wrist strap, a short USB-C to USB-A cable, and an instruction manual. The controller comes in two eye-catching colors: green and blue.</p>\n<p>Despite its small size, the controller packs a punch with its feature set. It includes all the essential buttons you'd expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>D-pad</li>\n<li>ABXY buttons (in Nintendo layout)</li>\n<li>L1, R1, L2, and R2 buttons</li>\n<li>Plus and minus buttons</li>\n<li>Star button</li>\n<li>8BitDo home button</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The buttons have a satisfying click to them, providing good tactile feedback. One notable omission is the lack of analog sticks, which limits its compatibility with some modern games but makes it perfect for retro and arcade-style titles.</p>\n<h2>Functionality and Compatibility: A Versatile Portable Bluetooth Gamepad</h2>\n<p>The 8BitDo Micro Bluetooth Controller offers impressive functionality for its size. On the bottom of the device, you'll find a switch with SDK options and a sync button. The SDK options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch mode for Nintendo Switch compatibility</li>\n<li>Keyboard mode for programmable Bluetooth functionality</li>\n<li>D-input mode for general gamepad use</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This versatility allows the controller to work with a wide range of devices and platforms. However, it's worth noting that the lack of analog sticks may limit its use in some modern games that require precise 360-degree movement.</p>\n<h2>8BitDo Ultimate Software App: Unleash Your Controller's Potential</h2>\n<p>One of the standout features of this controller is its compatibility with the <a href=\"https://support.8bitdo.com/ultimate/micro.html\">8BitDo Ultimate Software app</a>. This app allows you to customize the controller's buttons and create multiple profiles for different use cases. Here's how to get started:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the 8BitDo Ultimate Software app</li>\n<li>Turn on the controller and set it to pairing mode</li>\n<li>Connect the controller to your device via Bluetooth</li>\n<li>Set the controller to keyboard mode</li>\n<li>Open the app and start customizing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The app lets you assign any button on the controller to various keyboard functions, making it an incredibly versatile tool. Some unique use cases include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Controlling e-readers to flip pages remotely</li>\n<li>Operating teleprompters for video production</li>\n<li>Using it as a remote selfie button for your smartphone</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Gaming Performance: A Retro Gaming Controller's Dream</h2>\n<p>While the 8BitDo Micro Bluetooth Controller may not be suitable for all modern games, it shines when it comes to retro and arcade-style gaming. Its compact size and responsive buttons make it perfect for classic platformers, fighting games, and other titles that don't require analog input.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, you can even use this controller with PlayStation Remote Play through third-party apps like PX Play. While it won't work with the official PlayStation Remote Play app (which only supports DualShock 4, DualSense, or Backbone devices), third-party solutions open up new possibilities for PlayStation gamers on the go.</p>\n<p>One minor inconvenience is the Nintendo button layout, which swaps the positions of some buttons compared to the PlayStation layout. However, this can be easily remedied through in-game controls, system settings, or the remote play app itself.</p>\n<h2>Pros and Cons: Weighing the 8BitDo Controller Review</h2>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Extremely portable and travel-friendly</li>\n<li>Versatile with multiple connectivity options</li>\n<li>Customizable through the 8BitDo Ultimate Software app</li>\n<li>Affordable price point</li>\n<li>Great for retro and arcade-style games</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of analog sticks limits compatibility with some modern games</li>\n<li>Small size may not be comfortable for extended gaming sessions</li>\n<li>Nintendo button layout may require adjustment for PlayStation users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, the 8BitDo Micro Bluetooth Controller offers impressive value for its price. Its portability, versatility, and customization options make it an attractive option for gamers who prioritize on-the-go gaming or those looking for a compact, multipurpose Bluetooth remote.</p>\n<p>While it may not replace your primary gaming controller, it's an excellent complement to your gaming arsenal, especially for retro gaming enthusiasts or those who need a programmable Bluetooth remote for various devices.</p>\n<h2>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>\n<h4>What devices is the 8BitDo Micro Bluetooth Controller compatible with?</h4>\n<p>The controller is compatible with a wide range of devices, including Nintendo Switch, PCs, smartphones, and tablets. It can also be used with PlayStation Remote Play through third-party apps.</p>\n<h4>Can I use the 8BitDo Micro Bluetooth Controller for modern console games?</h4>\n<p>While it can be used for some modern games, the lack of analog sticks limits its compatibility with many contemporary titles that require precise 360-degree movement.</p>\n<h4>How long does the battery last on the 8BitDo Micro Bluetooth Controller?</h4>\n<p>The battery life varies depending on usage, but it typically lasts for several hours of gameplay.

            "summary": "For PlayStation Portal users, the HDR streaming issue has been a long-standing&hellip;",
            "content_html": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">For PlayStation Portal users, the HDR streaming issue has been a long-standing frustration. Despite the Portal's LCD screen lacking HDR support, the PS5 continues to stream an HDR signal, leading to blown-out visuals. While one would expect an easy fix from Sony, the issue persists. Fortunately, thanks to a clever workaround discovered by a Reddit user, there is now a simple solution to toggle HDR effectively.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the HDR Issue</h2>\n<p>The PlayStation Portal, with its LCD screen, does not support HDR. However, the PS5’s default settings may still transmit an HDR video signal, which results in an overexposed and washed-out image. Many users have tried turning off HDR settings on their PS5s, but Sony has restricted access to screen and display settings when using Remote Play, making the fix more challenging. Some users resort to unplugging their PS5’s HDMI cable as a workaround, which is highly inconvenient.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8P-7_CwNNw4?t=321s\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>Testing the Issue</h2>\n<p>Using HDR test footage, we have confirmed that the PlayStation Portal struggles with brightness levels above 350 nits, leading to significant loss of detail. Games like <em>Death Stranding</em>, <em>Mafia 2</em>, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and <em>Spider-Man 2</em> exhibit severe highlight loss, making the visuals almost unreadable in bright areas. Even when HDR is turned off, the conversion remains poor, failing to properly translate highlights into SDR levels.</p>\n<h2>The Quick Fix: Invert Colors Trick</h2>\n<p>A Reddit user named <em>dioro</em> discovered an effective method to disable HDR on the PlayStation Portal:</p>\n<h3>Steps to Disable HDR on PlayStation Portal</h3>\n<ol start=\"1\" data-spread=\"false\">\n<li>\n<p>Press the <strong>PlayStation button</strong> to open the Control Center.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Press the <strong>Options button</strong> to open the Edit menu.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add the <strong>Accessibility menu</strong> to your Control Center.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the Accessibility menu, enable <strong>Invert Colors</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Why This Works</h3>\n<p>On the PS5, enabling Invert Colors changes the screen’s color scheme, but on the PlayStation Portal, it effectively disables HDR. This trick successfully restores detail to bright areas, making visuals significantly clearer and preserving gameplay details that were previously washed out.</p>\n<h2>Comparing Before and After</h2>\n<p>Testing this fix on various games and HDR test footage confirms that inverting colors mimics the effect of fully disabling HDR. Details in bright skies, highlights in gameplay, and general visibility improve dramatically, making the PlayStation Portal experience much more enjoyable.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>While this isn’t the perfect solution (Sony should ideally provide an official HDR toggle for Remote Play), this workaround provides an easy and effective fix. If you’ve been struggling with HDR issues on the PlayStation Portal, try enabling Invert Colors through the Accessibility menu and enjoy a better viewing experience.</p>\n<hr>\n<figure

Luckily, with the new PSVR2 PC adapter, you can use entirely free software to enjoy your 3D movies in a massive virtual cinema. In this guide, I’ll show you step-by-step how to do this without re-encoding your movie files, saving you time and hassle.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KY38deZrl7s?t=240s\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>What You’ll Need</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PSVR2 headset</strong> and <strong>PC adapter</strong> (set up and configured for SteamVR)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A 3D Blu-ray movie</strong> (example: Top Gun 3D)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A Blu-ray drive for your PC</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>MakeMKV</strong> (to rip the Blu-ray to an MKV file)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>BD3D2MK3D</strong> (to convert the MKV file to a side-by-side 3D format)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AVISynth+</strong> (a required supplementary tool for BD3D2MK3D)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bigscreen Beta</strong> (a free VR app on Steam that allows you to watch movies in a virtual theater)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>VLC Media Player</strong> (to play the 3D movie)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 1: Rip the 3D Blu-ray with MakeMKV</h2>\n<p>MakeMKV is a free tool that lets you create digital copies of your physical Blu-ray discs. Here’s how:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Insert your 3D Blu-ray disc into your Blu-ray drive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open <strong>MakeMKV</strong> and select the Blu-ray drive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the options, <strong>make sure to check the 3D video track</strong>, as it may not be selected by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the ripping process. <strong>This will take some time</strong> (around an hour or more, depending on your PC and Blu-ray drive).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 2: Convert the MKV File to Side-by-Side 3D Format</h2>\n<p>Once you have your MKV file, you need to convert it into a side-by-side format, which is required for VR playback.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Open <strong>BD3D2MK3D</strong> and drag your newly created MKV file into the program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove any unnecessary audio and subtitle tracks to save space.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Uncheck the “half-quality” option if you want <strong>full-quality 3D video</strong> (note: this increases processing time).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the conversion. <strong>This can take about an hour</strong>, even on a high-performance computer.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>💡 <em>You’ll also need AVISynth+ installed for this process to work.</em></p>\n<h2>Step 3: Set Up Your Virtual Cinema in Bigscreen Beta</h2>\n<p>With your 3D movie ready, it’s time to experience it in VR.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Open <strong>SteamVR</strong> and make sure your PSVR2 is properly connected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch <strong>Bigscreen Beta</strong> from your Steam library.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose a theater environment (I prefer the fancy home theater setup, but you can pick any you like).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 4: Play Your 3D Movie in VR</h2>\n<p>Now, let’s get the movie playing in full 3D:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Open VLC Media Player</strong> and load your converted side-by-side 3D movie.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go full-screen in VLC so it fills the Bigscreen virtual theater.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Bigscreen Beta, press <strong>R3</strong> on your controller to open the settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the <strong>3D mode option</strong> and set it to <strong>side-by-side (SBS)</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your movie should now display correctly in stereoscopic 3D!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>While this process may seem a bit complex, it’s currently the best free method to watch 3D Blu-ray movies on the PSVR2. Thanks to MakeMKV, BD3D2MK3D, and Bigscreen Beta, you can enjoy your 3D content in a large virtual cinema <strong>without any paid software</strong>.</p>\n<p>If Sony ever enables native 3D Blu-ray support on PS5, this method won’t be necessary—but for now, this is the best solution available.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MakeMKV</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbGZVVVFabXZtRVY4TVg3dEpjQkdTWmlJYVVqQXxBQ3Jtc0tuRm44MkhkNlhtQWdGS2k3NnFyWkhTYlJQV0dqZXNBZUw2S29TcU5hMHNjQW1YN01iUnVMcjdaZk9XMXhUaDJsS19fV0ljb2N2cnhfQ1BxMkJTWkJNaWdDTUFkMEZUWS1Sc2lPRHBQUjBlaThxdDRsYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makemkv.com%2F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></a><a href=\"https://www.makemkv.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.makemkv.com/</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Bigscreen</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFlfVDNfUXBMbUxtU1ZleXRIbTFuLUV6YlZwZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttSDd4cThlSzdNRUNrSFdsQXVOOW92eFN0U2NjSjNkQ0h1SjBieTgxcUQ5d2NEaHROdTFkcDZad2tEVklHYUxYeGNMOXNKMjdfX2dlRGd5RTlGTkktVFBKQ3FNMnNQVzBfMWNrZjlsbVEwcTRzaGFXbw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F457550%2FBigscreen_Beta%2F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></a><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/45%E2%80%A6\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/45…</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> BD3D2MK3D</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbUZMTExzNTFHYVdoMDZqbHNGY0hZS2JodEJSUXxBQ3Jtc0trS0JLN1llcEU2Mno2ODRtd0FxMFBycTFJVHJQc0QyOXpib2gtcDE4TmNGM1NDUFBoQXRVYWJ5MEpIQVBuNVFtNFI1QjhDOHYySkNScVJYbWtOSzk2SXBoblJpLUZmUjZOb1EzcTRyRkVFeW1NVTVSNA&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.doom9.org%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D170828&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php...</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VLC</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbm5XNHRDUlVkWHE0VU8wYjVNVk1DMEhYRzNod3xBQ3Jtc0ttYmlsZnN0V1BHSUM0NS1JMER3Z25kRHJpRVZXT1diYjNaa2l5emFvdDFFeld4MWhqbS1kb0RhMktXVHd3cU42TnlORk9XR2ZYekpRRGhGLTFma3BEWXFxbXZ2NWdYRjhpeG5iOGNsU0RwMmVyRFVZUQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videolan.org%2F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://www.videolan.org/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4XVR</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbVhicVEwdFFITTNZUzQxcFV6dUtBZ0JQYjNLUXxBQ3Jtc0treHB3VzBORnFlS2JoQ1NOZUNRSEZleURFT25QT1FTdTlaYVkwN0I4ZzNndThJd1FIZHI4dnpMYUt1b1JZVl9GeEtLX3JXa0pxYkFhb3VPYWx6Z2JOY20zaHE3QklVZ1NRQTdWZXhKejR1SVpjbWVGZw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fm.4xvr.net%2F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://m.4xvr.net/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PS VR2</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbkJ4NHREa3ZodGJSdmt0ck4tMFBkbGQ5cVFyd3xBQ3Jtc0ttTFNyOVBQQmUtaTJZTmhMaVZXWkNlWlBoZk82QWNiZ0Jjc2kwa1RqNW1oc0VnYV9fQ0owSURfTEZWclZpQ2ZGVnVFTmlWUEVuMWR1UFRLMFhOQTBrWGU2WFZReGFQcWsxYjhEM0VLTUl2TFNjVFBIcw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F47TKn4F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://amzn.to/47TKn4F</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PS VR2 PC Adapter</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEgwQ2o1Z3FfWlk1Sms1eWRwTWhaak9JVlFoUXxBQ3Jtc0tsaTFJY3BUWTZWY3lobS1vWnZKQmpvX2NQNGV3M3NnOUpyMnJEaDhlcXktSk9BZmdqbnJ2ZlUteU9UMFd0SkhZZXlVcHdJalU4WmRsSkFUMjE3WTdSS0NxczAzbWE5ZjFSOVMxMmU5UHdka0YtM2RWUQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3BxVq7B&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://amzn.to/3BxVq7B</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top Gun 3D</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa1p6VVp2cVhTTU9Fb09PYjdYMDFITUFxc2V4QXxBQ3Jtc0ttSk9qOWY4djIzbktGbG85ajZ4Y2VYMmJlTjQxMTJ1V1hiOEE0SGRSV3VwQU9CeUtvdnoxSE9rb2VTYU1XYUZHMzk2ZjFSRE9YNUMzcGxGY09NRFl3TEFjWTlwXzIxSnl3VUxZY2hYVkdDaDNrZFJ4aw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F4h3HylY&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://amzn.to/4h3HylY</span></a></p>",

Thanks to some clever tech wizardry, you can dust off those old favorites and experience them in virtual reality. If you've got a beefy PC and missed the 3D gaming craze, this guide will walk you through bringing those games back to life with your PSVR2 headset.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z1q8DRJWSXY?t=145s\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>Getting RPCS3 Ready for 3D PS3 Action</h2>\n<p>First things first, we need to set up RPCS3, the PS3 emulator that'll make the magic happen. Here's a quick rundown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grab RPCS3 from their official site and install it.</li>\n<li>Tweak RPCS3 settings for best performance (check their website for game-specific tips).</li>\n<li>Use PS3 Disc Dumper to create digital copies of your games (keep it legal, folks).</li>\n<li>Set up custom configs for each 3D game you want to play.</li>\n<li>Turn on 3D side-by-side options in those custom configs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Quick heads up: For 3D to work properly in RPCS3, stick with 720p resolution. It's not perfect yet, so cranking it higher might cause some wonky issues.</p>\n<h2>Big Screen Beta: Your Virtual Cinema Setup</h2>\n<p>Next up is Big Screen Beta, a free app on Steam that turns your VR space into a personal theater. Here's how to get it going:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download Big Screen Beta from Steam.</li>\n<li>Fire it up and hop into VR mode.</li>\n<li>Pick your favorite virtual hangout (home theater, big cinema, you name it).</li>\n<li>Set it up to show your PC desktop on the virtual screen.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Hooking Up Your PSVR2 to PC</h2>\n<p>To get your PSVR2 talking to your PC, you'll need a PSVR2 to PC adapter. This little gizmo lets you connect your headset to your computer, opening up a whole world of PC VR content. Make sure you've got it set up right before moving on.</p>\n<h2>Let's Play Some PS3 3D Games: Step-by-Step</h2>\n<p>Alright, time for the main event. Here's how to get those PS3 3D games running on your PSVR2:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start up RPCS3 and load your 3D game of choice.</li>\n<li>Open Big Screen Beta and pick your virtual spot.</li>\n<li>In Big Screen Beta settings, turn on side-by-side 3D options.</li>\n<li>Enable 3D options in-game (this might be different for each game).</li>\n<li>Fiddle with the aspect ratio in Big Screen Beta if things look stretched.</li>\n<li>Tweak performance settings as needed for smooth gameplay.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The Nitty-Gritty: Performance and Limitations</h2>\n<p>When you're emulating PS3 3D games on PC, you might hit a few snags:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You're stuck with 720p for 3D to work properly.</li>\n<li>Frame rates can be all over the place, depending on your PC's muscle and the game.</li>\n<li>Some games might act up or have weird graphical glitches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's worth playing around with different games and settings to find that sweet spot between looks and performance.</p>\n<h2>Squeezing the Most Out of RPCS3 for 3D Games</h2>\n<p>Want to get the best performance? Try these tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check out the RPCS3 compatibility database for game-specific tweaks.</li>\n<li>Play with CPU and GPU settings in RPCS3 to match what your PC can handle.</li>\n<li>Use custom configs for each game to fine-tune things.</li>\n<li>Experiment with different rendering options to balance visuals and frame rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Future of Retro VR Gaming</h2>\n<p>As VR tech and emulation keep getting better, we can expect even cooler ways to play PS3 3D games in virtual reality. This setup is just the beginning, bridging the gap between old-school gaming and modern VR tech. Who knows what kind of retro VR experiences we'll be able to cook up next?</p>\n<h2>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>\n<h4>What PS3 3D games work best with this setup?</h4>\n<p>Games like MotorStorm Apocalypse and Uncharted 3 work well, but performance may vary.

Emulating PS3 games and running VR simultaneously can be demanding on your hardware.</p>\n<h4>Can I use other VR headsets besides PSVR2?</h4>\n<p>While this guide focuses on PSVR2, you can use other PC-compatible VR headsets with a similar setup. The process may vary slightly depending on the headset you're using.</p>\n<h4>Is it legal to emulate PS3 games on PC?</h4>\n<p>Emulation itself is legal, but you should only use digital copies of games you own physically.

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indika is a narrative-driven singleplayer third-person game with puzzles, platforming elements, and a very slick cinematic presentation. This game is right up my alley because I am an avid movie watcher, and the developers say this game is inspired by arthouse cinema from the likes of Yorgos Lanthimos, Ari Aster, and Darren Aronofsky. In this game you play as a Nun named Indika in 19th century Russia, who struggles with her faith and her peers, and regularly battles with a very manipulative inner demon. This game might look like a horror game on the surface as well, but it never really delves into horror specifically, but it definitely aims to make you uneasy, and a few moments really gave me chills or made me go “holy krap”. With all that said, it is very much a cinematic or even walking-simulator type adventure game that's very beautifully presented but not a very deep experience gameplay wise by any means. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qJYPtTBI2mQ\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gameplay</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The closest types of games to this off the top of my head are other indie-adventure games like Hellblade or Plague Tale, but this is even more simple and passive in its gameplay elements. There are a couple, very simple platforming puzzles and challenges throughout the game as well as some linear chase sequences, but none are particularly difficult. Generally the puzzles come down to basic platforming, using various levers and mechanical systems to move platforms and obstacles, and occasional supernatural forces. On the upside, each set piece and puzzle is quite unique from each other despite their simplicity so you won’t feel like you are doing the same challenge over and over. They often present a new mechanic and environment for each challenge with very little recycling throughout the 2-3 hour experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the other notable gameplay elements in this adventure are the points you see in the top left. When you complete tasks, find collectibles, or even pray, you collect these points, which is a very gamer-centric and cynical way of viewing Indika’s faith. Which in many ways is the point of the game. While I can see a lot of players turning off the GUI outright to hide these points, I thought they were pretty cheeky and a funny mechanic because of the thematic implications. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between certain chapters there are 2D platforming sections that reveal flashbacks about Indika’s life and origins, which are a bit jarring compared to the presentation of the rest of the game but they tell the simple story well enough. And the pixel art was also really strong in it’s own regard. And they are not super difficult either even though I died so much. I’m just bad at 2D games…</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do wish there was a stronger connection or through line between the 3D and 2D levels than just the point indicators though. he game only hard hard cuts between the two as it is now and maybe they could’ve done more to ease the transition or even have pixelated elements seep into the 3D world on occasion or something, I’m not sure what but it feels too much like two different games other than the connective storyline.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Presentation/graphics</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I’ve said a couple times already, the graphics in this game are spectacular, it runs off of Unreal Engine 4 and really showcases the power and capabilities of this engine, even in the hands of smaller indie studios. In many cutscenes the faces and details are as good as many AAA games, and the atmosphere throughout the game is really really hauntingly isolated and spooky. Even the level design and blocking felt really strong, I was never lost or feeling artificially funneled through the world even though it’s a strictly linear game. And there was enough sense of exploration to find collectibles and other details in this surreal Russian winter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did see occasional pop-in, in particular when the game cuts between camera angles in cutscenes as well as some slowdown in some specific more open areas, but otherwise the game ran at a really nice 60fps 4K.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motion capture and animation work was great and the game has some realy wonderful cinematography as you may have seen from some of the earlier trailers. They are not shy to have closeups with these characters and the graphics and details really hold up well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game does have distinct chapters and levels, and they don’t feel super repetitive again, each one is distinct but increasingly surreal as you progress through Indika’s story. I love the exaggerated industrial levels in particular. There’s a massive canning factory that is almost portal 2-esque in its ridiculous scale and atmosphere, and some levels seem to climb up forever like the tower of babel. The environmental design reminds me of a industrial russian version of the Oldest house from Control in a lot of ways.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Story</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plot starts off as Indika is a generally disliked Nun among her cloister, and she is tasked to deliver a letter to another monastery. The story quickly gets swept into a different direction as she meets a local prison escapee and for all intents and purposes is forced to help him on his journey. Through dialogue and flashbacks their experience with faith, loyalty, and trust over the rest of the game.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Audio</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audio design in this game is really great, but it’s also the part where I had the most issues. The environments are very isolating and cold, and the detailed foley and voicework is really great. However, it might get patched at some point but I had a lot of volume issues throughout the game. Take a look at my game capture timeline of the entire game and you can see how quiet and loud some chapters are compared to one another. And even in certain conversations, Indika and other characters' volume levels would be so different for no apparent reason. I did play this on a soundbar and I didn’t see much in the options for audio output settings so maybe that didn’t help and it would all be great in headphones. But I still think there were some problems in the audio department overall, especially just looking at those captured levels.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concluding Thoughts</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was able to finish the game in about 2.5 hours, and then another 30-45 minutes to wrap up the remaining trophies. And thanks to Odd Meter sending me a review code I was able to snag one of the earliest Platinums in this game in the world as well which was a fun first for me. Anyways, my overall thoughts are that this game was great. If you are really into cinematic games, third person adventure games, or even arthouse movies, you will probably dig Indika. If you are more into action games, this might not jive with you as it is mostly a walking sim with not a lot of innovative puzzles. The story and presentation is the real highlight here.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O30gBiC3r5s\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<hr>\n<p>Indika PS5 <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4cLpNGl\">https://amzn.to/4cLpNGl</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>It’s been a few months since the PlayStation Portal launched, and while it initially faced mixed and negative feedback, it has been selling incredibly well. In some markets, it remains difficult to find, proving that despite its flaws, there’s a strong demand for the device. As someone who relies on Remote Play frequently, I picked one up as soon as I could and have been using it regularly. While I have some major gripes with it, I also think it has a lot to offer. Let’s break it all down, starting with the hardware.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z21i63eJUro\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>The Hardware: Design Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p>When the PlayStation Portal was first leaked, I did a reaction video, and my opinion hasn’t changed—I still dislike the design. The overall aesthetic of the PS5 generation just doesn’t appeal to me, especially when compared to previous PlayStation generations. It’s strange, considering that Mark Cerny has led PlayStation console design since the Vita, yet the PS5 and its accessories feel like such a radical departure from his past work.</p>\n<p>That said, while the Portal looks odd, its form factor is actually fantastic for ergonomics. It sits between the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch in size, but many reviews—and my own experience—suggest that it’s more comfortable to hold than both. This is because it essentially splits a DualSense controller in half, placing the screen in the middle. This design makes it one of the most comfortable handhelds to use for long sessions.</p>\n<p>The placement of the charging port and aux port could be better, as they’re slightly difficult to reach. However, I do appreciate the small lip on the back of the device, which makes it easy to pick up and hold without smudging the screen. But while the physical design has its strengths, the screen introduces one of the Portal’s biggest flaws—its HDR issues.</p>\n<h2>HDR Issues: A Major Problem</h2>\n<p>The PlayStation Portal has significant problems with HDR when streaming via Remote Play. Many users, including myself, have encountered this issue, and the lack of updates to fix it is frustrating. Even worse are the absurd workarounds being suggested online, which are simply unacceptable.<br><br></p>\n<blockquote class=\"reddit-embed-bq\" data-embed-height=\"546\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/185m4dc/hdr_comparison_shots/\">HDR Comparison shots</a><br>by<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bombchu_/\">u/bombchu_</a> in<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/\">PlaystationPortal</a></blockquote>\n<p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, here’s the problem: the Portal receives an HDR signal from the PS5, despite being an SDR LCD screen that doesn’t have the luminance range to properly display HDR content. This results in overexposed, blown-out whites, making some games nearly unplayable. For example, in NHL games, the ice and bright jerseys become indistinguishable, creating a terrible experience. I’ve also noticed this issue in games like Spider-Man and Hogwarts Legacy, where the sky turns into a solid white blotch, losing all cloud detail and depth.</p>\n<p>The most commonly suggested solution? Unplugging your PS5’s HDMI cable every time you want to use Remote Play. That’s a ridiculous fix that completely defeats the purpose of a remote experience. Other suggestions include turning off VRR, limiting the PS5 to 1080p, or disabling 120Hz refresh rates—though these solutions seem more related to latency than HDR. To make matters worse, when using Remote Play, you cannot access the PS5’s Screen and Video settings to disable HDR, meaning there’s no easy way to fix this problem without physically interacting with your console.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--wide\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/23/gallery/ps-portal-rant.00_04_17_23.still001.png\" data-size=\"1920x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/23/gallery/ps-portal-rant.00_04_17_23.still001-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/23/gallery/ps-portal-rant.00_04_45_05.still003.png\" data-size=\"1920x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/23/gallery/ps-portal-rant.00_04_45_05.still003-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2>Testing the Issue: What’s Really Going On?</h2>\n<p>I ran multiple tests on my PS5, TV, and Portal setup to understand the root of the issue. Here’s what I found:</p>\n<h3>Test Scenarios</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>HDMI Link (Optimal Setup):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Auto → Problem occurs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Off → Fixes the issue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>HDMI Unplugged:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Auto → Problem occurs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Off → Fixes the issue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No HDMI Link:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Auto → Problem occurs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Off → Fixes the issue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key takeaway? HDMI Link is not the issue; it’s the way the PS5 interprets HDR compatibility with the TV and sends the signal to the Portal.</p>\n<p>To further verify this, I tested Remote Play using the official Android app and PS Play on a phone that supports HDR. Both apps exhibited the same blown-out whites when HDR was enabled on the PS5 but disabled in the app. However, when HDR was enabled on both the PS5 and the app, the image looked great.</p>\n<p>One interesting discovery: if you connect to your PS5 <strong>while it is already inside the Screen and Video settings menu</strong>, you can still adjust HDR settings remotely. This means the PS5 is capable of dynamically adjusting the HDR output during a Remote Play session—it just doesn’t allow users to access these settings normally. A simple firmware update from Sony could fix this by either (1) allowing users to access the Screen and Video settings during Remote Play or (2) automatically disabling HDR output when streaming to a non-HDR device like the Portal.</p>\n<h2>Latency Issues: Improving but Not Perfect</h2>\n<p>Sony released an update (version 2.06) on April 2nd, which reportedly improved video bitrate quality. While I’ve noticed that the Portal now holds its 1080p connection better, some latency and stuttering issues remain. Previously, if my TV was streaming video, the Portal’s stream quality would degrade and never recover unless I manually disconnected and reconnected. Since the update, it appears to handle these situations more gracefully, but only time will tell how well this holds up over extended use.</p>\n<h2>Hacking the Portal: TheFlow0’s Findings</h2>\n<p>Earlier this year, hacker TheFlow0 managed to exploit the Portal, but Sony quickly patched the vulnerability in version 2.06. While this is disappointing for those of us who hoped to run homebrew apps on the device, TheFlow0 stated that he never intended to release the exploit publicly. He also noted that officially reporting security flaws to Sony only delays the inevitable patches by a few weeks. At some point, the exploit details will be disclosed publicly, but for now, Sony has locked down the device.</p>\n<h2>The Future of the Portal</h2>\n<p>The PlayStation Portal remains a mixed bag. On the one hand, it offers a fantastic ergonomic experience and a continually improving streaming quality. On the other hand, the HDR issue is a significant flaw that needs urgent attention.</p>\n<p>Sony has two potential solutions: either give users access to the Screen and Video settings during Remote Play or implement a backend fix that forces SDR output when streaming to non-HDR devices. Until then, Portal users will have to deal with frustrating workarounds.</p>\n<p>If you’re experiencing this issue, I’d love to hear about your setup—what kind of TV are you using, and are you seeing the same problems? Let me know in the comments, and let’s hope Sony addresses this sooner rather than later.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8P-7_CwNNw4\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<hr>\n<p><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string yt-core-attributed-string--white-space-pre-wrap\" dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\">PS Portal </span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"><a class=\"yt-core-attributed-string__link yt-core-attributed-string__link--call-to-action-color\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEFZSHBNM3pFYTZyVXBQOFhuNTVYR1owcDZmQXxBQ3Jtc0ttdEZoMDE5dkx4VFRtdzFzZWZsVUtHU0lIWHVMdmtRVkh5MjNMbXhDT0l2S1Awc0VIZXp2Y3RTaVdVMkZPbjNsM1NaY05UZWM5NmN3bWxZclNHZ0F1N2drbm9pRkVfRlRpWnJKN3l4blFYVVUydWc3VQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3VwoRi3&amp;v=z21i63eJUro\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" force-new-state=\"true\" tabindex=\"0\">https://amzn.to/3VwoRi3</a></span></span></p>",
